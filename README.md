# Study Buddy 
Study Buddy is a website for students who wish to assign tasks (called assignments) to other students. The aim is to allow students to work together collaboratively by giving each other assignments to complete. Each user can take the role of a tutor or tutee depending on if they have been assigned an assignment, or if they have assigned someone else.
