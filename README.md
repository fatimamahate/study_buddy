# Study Buddy 
Study Buddy is a website for students who wish to assign tasks (called assignments) to other students. The aim is to allow students to work together collaboratively by giving each other assignments to complete. Each user can take the role of a tutor or tutee depending on if they have been assigned an assignment, or if they have assigned someone else.

## User Experience(UX)
The aim is to create a website that can Create, Read, Update and Delete assignments. The user should only be able to view projects assigned to them and the projects thtt they have assigned to other users. 

## User Stories
These are the user stories for this project:
* As a **site user**, I want to **view assignments assigned to me**, so that **I can complete them.**
* As a **site user**, I want to **add assignments**, so that I can **give other users assignments.** 
* As a **site user**, I want to **edit assignments,** so that I can **fix mistakes or change assignment content, change tutee.** 
* As a **site user**, I would like to **easily see the page I am on** so that **I am sure of what I am doing with the assignment**

---
* As a **site user**, I want to **login to the website**, so that I can **view my dashboard.** 
* As a **new user**, I would like to **sign up**, so that **I can use the website.**

## Epics
* User Stories can be combined to create Epics. They are split up with a line like this
